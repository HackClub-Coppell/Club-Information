Welcome to Hack Club. Hack Club Coppell is part of a global movement to teach young students to program. Hack Club Coppell is an after school club hosted on an online platform for students to work on workshops and build projects. Since our club is hosted on an online platform anyone from the ages between 12-18 can join. We will hold workshops and team projects on Google Hangouts on weekly basis.
